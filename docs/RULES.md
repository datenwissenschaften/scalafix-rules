## RemoveScalaDoc

The **RemoveScalaDoc** rule is a Scalafix rule designed to automatically remove all ScalaDoc comments from a codebase.
This rule aligns with the principles of clean code, which emphasize simplicity, readability,
and clarity directly within the code itself, without relying on extensive external documentation.

### Purpose

ScalaDoc comments, while helpful in some cases, can often become outdated, redundant, or unnecessary in a well-designed codebase.
When code is clean and written in a self-explanatory manner, comments should not be needed to understand the functionality. Code that clearly
expresses its purpose through meaningful names, straightforward logic, and encapsulation of complex behaviors into well-defined methods and classes
often renders ScalaDocs redundant.

By removing ScalaDocs:

- **Maintain Clean Code:** The removal of excessive comments enforces the discipline of writing self-explanatory code, making developers think
  carefully about naming conventions and modular design.
- **Reduce Redundancy:** Redundant comments that merely repeat what is already clear in the code (e.g., “This method calculates the sum of two
  integers”) add noise and clutter, distracting from the actual logic.
- **Ease of Maintenance:** ScalaDocs can quickly become outdated if not maintained rigorously, especially in fast-evolving codebases. Outdated
  comments mislead readers and increase cognitive load, while up-to-date, self-explanatory code does not require frequent documentation updates.
- **Foster Readability and Consistency:** Removing unnecessary ScalaDoc keeps the code visually streamlined, emphasizing code readability and making
  it easier to see the overall structure without interspersed blocks of comments.

### Why Use RemoveScalaDoc?

In a codebase that prioritizes clean code principles, the RemoveScalaDoc rule allows for focused development and prevents developers from over-relying
on comments as a crutch.
Instead, they are encouraged to make the code itself the best source of documentation. This approach can be particularly valuable for teams adopting
Agile methodologies,
where rapid iterations and clear, concise code enhance collaboration and reduce the overhead of maintaining external documentation.

By applying the RemoveScalaDoc rule, we aim to make our codebase leaner, less error-prone, and more aligned with the clean code philosophy,
ultimately leading to a more sustainable, maintainable, and intuitive codebase.

## SingleLineNestedExpressions

The **SingleLineNestedExpressions** rule is a Scalafix rule created to transform all nested expressions into single-line statements,
followed by the application of Scalafmt for consistent code formatting. This rule enforces a cleaner, more concise code style that enhances
readability and aligns with a consistent coding standard across the codebase.

### Purpose

Nested expressions, when spread across multiple lines, can introduce unnecessary complexity and reduce the readability of code,
especially when the expressions are short and can comfortably fit on a single line. This rule aims to:

- **Enhance Readability:** Single-line nested expressions minimize vertical spacing, making it easier to follow the flow of logic. By condensing
  straightforward expressions, developers can quickly understand the purpose of each line without scrolling or deciphering fragmented code.
- **Increase Consistency:** When expressions are transformed to single lines and then formatted with Scalafmt, the codebase gains a consistent style.
  This consistency reduces cognitive load, allowing developers to focus on the logic rather than formatting differences.
- **Streamline Maintenance:** Single-line expressions make code more maintainable, as short, unfragmented lines are easier to scan and modify. This
  structure is particularly useful in team environments, where developers may have different formatting habits. Standardizing on single-line
  expressions helps reduce potential merge conflicts related to formatting.

### Why Use SingleLineNestedExpressions?

By adopting the SingleLineNestedExpressions rule, we foster a streamlined, well-organized codebase that aligns with clean code practices.
This approach enforces a more consistent look across the codebase and prevents nested expressions from becoming visually cluttered. Following the
transformation, applying Scalafmt ensures all single-line nested expressions adhere to a unified style, contributing to a cohesive, readable, and
professional codebase.

This rule promotes code simplicity and consistency, making code review and collaboration smoother and reducing the mental overhead required to
interpret nested expressions. As a result, the **SingleLineNestedExpressions** rule supports a cleaner, more efficient, and maintainable code
environment.
